First read prisma.schema and understand the relationships between the tables.

Then read the code in the following files and understand the code and the logic.
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/planner/types/calendar.ts
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/planner/types/event.ts
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/planner/utils.ts
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/planner/services/planner.ts
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/planner/components/EventTimingsCalendar.tsx
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/planner/components/EventManagementDashboard.tsx
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/planner/components/EventCarousel.tsx

app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/requests/components/RequestedSlotsDialog.tsx
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/requests/components/TimingsCalendar.tsx
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/requests/page.tsx
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/requests/RequestSlotAllocationTab.tsx
app/dashboard/consultant/[consultantId]/(features)/requests/types.ts

The apis concerned are

/api/events/consultations/[consultationId]/allocate
/api/events/consultations/[consultationId]/validate
/api/events/subscriptions/[subscriptionId]/allocate
/api/events/subscriptions/[subscriptionId]/validate
/api/events/webinars/[webinarId]/allocate
/api/events/webinars/[webinarId]/validate
/api/events/classes/[classId]/allocate
/api/events/classes/[classId]/validate

The Timings Calendar(for consultations and subscriptions) and Event Timings Calendar(for webinars and classes) are kind of redundant.
Maybe there are minor bugs in both of them.
but the idea is to have UnifiedCalendar.tsx that is imported in both of their parents and completely get rid of these.

The calendar just like the present one should show booked, partially booked(with the appointment booked name) , available, conflicting(new status and in red) slots.

there are 3 allocation algorithms
Manual allocate - Allocates the selected slots from the UnifiedCalendar
Auto allocate - Allocates the first available slots in sight
Pre Allocate(use Requested Times from RequestedSlotsDialog) - Allocates the slots requested by the consultee himself.

we also need to verify if algorithms in apis are correct and need some upgrades.
if possible you can create

shared/components/UnifiedCalendar.tsx, shared/utils/manykindsofutils, shared/hooks/\*,

Some of the files are already created.
But the code is not working as expected.
So you need to fix the code and make it work as expected.
You can also create new files if needed.

The allocate and validate apis need any improvement/optimisation/fixing ?
